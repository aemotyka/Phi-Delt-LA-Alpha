                    <p>Founded in 1848 by a visionary group called the Immortal Six, Phi Delta Theta has long been known for thinking differently about what it means to be a Greek organization and its impact on the greater society. Phi Delta Theta has remained faithful to its original three Cardinal Principles while also evoking a culture of innovation and fearlessness, pursuing greatness in the lifelong journey of members. Helping every individual to meet his true potential is the bedrock of the Phi Delta Theta Fraternity. By celebrating each person’s true self, and by learning from each other’s strengths while helping to improve each other’s weaknesses, every member of Phi Delta Theta develops into a greater version of himself than he could ever on his own.</p>

                    <p>On a cold winter night in 1848, the Immortal Six gathered in Miami, Ohio, where they decided to establish a lifelong friendship through the bonds of brotherhood. They chose to name this brotherhood Phi Delta Theta. Over time, Phi Delta Theta would become present on many college campuses. In 1889, Tulane University became one of these, and the Louisiana Alpha chapter was born. Today, Phi Delta Theta has over 190 chapters accross the United States and Canada. In November 2023, the Louisiana Alpha chapter of Phi Delta Theta recieved its charter and was re-installed. Today, we have 56 initiated brothers and are projected to have 83 by the end of the Spring 2024 semester, making us the second largest fraternity on campus.</p>

                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Friendship</h3>
                    <p>If you ask our members what they have received from their Phi Delta Theta membership, you’ll often hear about an experience filled with brotherhood and mutual respect. Great friendships are a crucial component of living well, and Phi Delta Theta challenges its members to create long-term and meaningful relationships with each other that stand the test of time. Through the ups and downs of life, relationships built through fraternity offer our members a strong foundation, network, and support structure.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Sound Learning</h3>
                    <p>Sound Learning is much more than getting good grades. It’s about intellectual curiosity and the search for truth. It’s about well-roundedness and becoming cultured in all aspects of life. Phi Delta Theta challenges its members to live a life of continuous learning, and we invest in educational experiences that offer new dimensions of knowledge that may not be taught in the classroom, such as soft skills, work ethic, leadership, and compassion for others.</p>
                    <h3 style="text-align: left;">Rectitude</h3>
                    <p>Rectitude can be defined in many ways, but the Fraternity resonates with its qualities of honesty, integrity, character, kindness, and compassion. As men of strong moral character, we are called to exemplify the principles upon which we were founded and that we, as Phi Delts, swear to uphold. Though all our principles are considered equal, Rectitude is what guides us into becoming the greatest versions of ourselves.</p>

            <h2>Brotherhood</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Phi Delta Theta holds true to the cardinal principle of friendship. We believe our friendship with each other helps us grow closer together forming brotherhood. Friendship is more giving than taking and at Louisiana Alpha we strive to see that through. With a projected 80 members following Spring 2024, our brotherhood will have more than doubled in less than 2 years and continues to grow stronger each semester.</p>

                <p>LA Alpha has a plethora of brotherhood events each semester that allow us to get together and have fun outside of school and bond with our brothers. We do all sorts of different things. From renting out movie theaters for blockbuster films to pumpkin dodgeball and hotdog eating contests in the backyard, brotherhood events are always staples of the semester.</p>

            <div>
                <p>Social events are the heartbeat of a strong fraternity. Louisiana Alpha maintains a robust social calendar full of vibrant events and fun opportunities for networking. Social events help us strengthen our brotherhood, foster growth, and create a strong sense of belonging.</p>

                <p>Louisiana Alpha has a number of social events throughout the school year including date parties, barbecues, and other community events, and a formal every semester. In addition, every Mardi Gras, the brothers camp out on St. Charles and host a parade viewing area for the chapter and its guests. The memories we make at these events help shape the bond that creates Phi Delta Theta’s unique brotherhood.</p>

            <h2>Philanthropy</h2>
            <div>
                <p>Louisiana Alpha’s philanthropic events and proceeds go towards the non-profit Live Like Lou, an organization built for supporting families with ALS and funding research for ALS, honoring the great New York Yankees first baseman and fellow brother Lou Gehrig. Our chapter has honored his legacy and the mission of ALS research through a partnership with a family affected by ALS in New Orleans, and the Iron Phi Program in which individuals raise $1,000 for Live Like Lou and complete a physical activity of their choice. Within our first year as an emerging chapter, 1/4 of our brothers became Iron Phis, and raised over $10,000 for ALS research. This lead to our chapter being recognized with Triple Crown Status, and we continue to strive for this cause year after year.</p>

            <div>
                <p>The Louisiana Alpha Chapter’s commitment to community service embodies the core values of brotherhood, community engagement and social responsibility. It is a collective commitment within the fraternity to make a positive impact on the local New Orleans Society through various charitable endeavors and public service initiatives. From volunteering with the Coastal Restoration Society of Louisiana (CRCL) and the Second Harvest Food Bank, our chapter demonstrates a dedication to social service at the local level. For Spring of 2024, this chapter has focused its volunteering towards tutoring in the many underfunded school districts of New Orleans and assisting an educational non profit called Excite All Stars.</p>

        <h2>Fundraising</h2>
        <p>Hello! As you may know, Phi Delta Theta at Tulane is a newly reestablished fraternity. As the Louisiana Alpha chapter, we are trying to bring a new Greek life culture to this school. By creating a chapter without hazing, hate, and discrimination, we hope to break the stigma many fraternities have. In just our first year, we raised over $10,000 through Iron Phi challenges, all going to ALS research. This made us a “Triple Crown” chapter, a prestigious award for an emerging fraternity. We have also become the second largest fraternity at Tulane, while also achieving the second highest chapter GPA. We are incredibly proud of what we have accomplished thus far, but there is more to be done.

            Since we are so new, we are a huge step behind other fraternities, who are funded by donors and have extensive alumni networks. Currently, we do not have enough funds for future housing, events, and new member recruitment. We will be formally initiated as national brothers of Phi Delta Theta later this semester, which will cost us thousands of dollars and a major percentage of our chapter dues- a very high price for such a new fraternity. One of our goals is to establish a temporary fraternity house to launch our rebuilding activities, conduct fraternity business, and host recruitment events. Since we are a new chapter here, we have to build cash reserves to fund our activities, including rent for our house.
            
            Below is a link to donate to the Louisiana Alpha chapter. With the help of your generosity, we can help build a legacy at Tulane, and create memories for years to come. Thank you so much!
            
            Sincerely, The Brothers of Phi Delta Theta</p>
